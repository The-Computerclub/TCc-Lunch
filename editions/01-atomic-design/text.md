Next wednesday The Hague Tech will be hosting the first lunch edition of "The Computerclub"! Learn and get inspired about interesting computer topics during lunch!

In our first edition we will be talking about Brad Frost's "Atomic Design". Come and share your feelings about this wild concept, or learn about what it is and how it may make your life a little bit "better".

Also, Brad Frost wrote a free book on "Atomic Design", read it here -> https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/.
